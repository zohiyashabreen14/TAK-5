# TASK-5
Titanic Survival Analysis
Project Overview
This project analyzes the Titanic passenger dataset to explore which factors influenced survival rates. The analysis focuses on understanding relationships between features such as gender, age, passenger class, fare, and survival outcomes.

Dataset
The dataset used is the classic Titanic dataset from Kaggle's Titanic: Machine Learning from Disaster.
Key features analyzed:
Pclass (Ticket Class)
Sex
Age
Fare
Embarked
Survived (Target variable)

Key Steps
Data cleaning (handling missing values, selecting important features)
Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) with visualizations
Analysis of survival rates based on gender, class, age, fare, and embarkation point
Interpretation of patterns and insights

Findings
Gender: Females had a significantly higher survival rate compared to males.
Passenger Class: 1st-class passengers had much higher survival rates than 3rd-class passengers.
Age: Children (under 10) had better chances of survival, while older adults had lower chances.
Fare: Higher fare amounts correlated with better survival odds.
Embarked Port: Passengers who embarked from Cherbourg (C) had higher survival rates.

Conclusion
The study highlights that survival on the Titanic was heavily influenced by socio-economic status (class), gender, and age. Women, children, and wealthy passengers had better chances during the disaster.
